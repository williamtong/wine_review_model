It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy texture akin to lemon custard yet stays refreshing through the finish. Drink now through 2010.   \n",
       "2     Aged in 25% new French oak, the rest of it neutral, this age-worthy Chardonnay shows refreshing restraint, though it retains plenty of fruit. The aromas tend toward faint caramel and a complex web of acidity and brightness accompanies notes of apple and pear, a long finish capping things off.   \n",

Fresh apple and pear flavors are bright, but enveloped in a midpalate of butter and cream. Drink now.   \n",

Brisk acidity off sets a palate that's rich and substantial in texture.   \n",

It's dominated by the aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramelized, vanilla accented wood. Underneath all that are some pretty good pineapple, peach and pear flavors.   \n",

The finish remains crisp though abbreviated.   \n",
